## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected access to care across the United States due to such factors as diversion of medical resources and personnel, reduced access to transportation, and fear of transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities. In addition to fears related to the pandemic,  public health measures in place to reduce its spread may cause an increase in mental health needs. The U.S. Census Bureau, the CDC, and four additional federal agencies have conducted the Household Pulse Survey to measure social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these data are indicators of reduced access to care and depression/anxiety symptoms. In this analysis, we explore the relationships between reduced access to healthcare and mental health symptoms in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Dataset

Data were obtained from the Household Pulse Survey,  which measures [indicators of anxiety or depression symptoms](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/indicators-anxiety-or-depression-based-reported-frequency-symptoms-during-last-7-days) and [indicators of delayed or reduced access to care](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/indicators-reduced-access-care-due-coronavirus-pandemic-during-last-4-weeks) over the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
<br></br>

## Findings

Visualization of the data by survey time period reveals a positive correlation between proportion of individuals who report mental health symptoms and proportion of individuals who report reduced access to care during some of the 2-week intervals, particularly the most recent survey time periods. Further analysis can be found in our detailed project report.

## Mental Health Resources

These data demonstrate an increase in mental health needs that coincides with decreased access to care. The CDC has compiled mental health  [resources](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html) for coping with the increase in stressors and mental health needs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
