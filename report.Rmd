## Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected access to care across the United States due to such factors as diversion of medical resources and personnel, reduced access to transportation, and fear of transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities. In addition to fears related to the pandemic, public health measures in place to reduce its spread may be associated with an increase in mental health needs. The U.S. Census Bureau, the CDC, and four additional federal agencies have conducted the Household Pulse Survey to measure social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these data are indicators of reduced access to care and depression/anxiety symptoms. The coincidince of increased mental health symptoms and reduced access to healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic may reveal unmet mental health needs.

## Initial Questions and Goal

We propose to investigate whether there exists a correlation between reduced access to care and depression/anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 using these data. We will compare reduction in access to care and mental health outcomes by age, gender, race, education and state.

## Related Work

The effect of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic on access to mental healthcare and the prevalence of mental illness in the general population is currently unknown. The following projects have provided recommendations and/or examined preliminary data to address these questions:

* [Human needs in COVID-19 isolation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1359105320925149?casa_token=wSRi-0u2RlsAAAAA%3AGsLCwQZQ6_EORL0wBOUi3mYJisP0ZN0WOl1kP1aJClaH4j12Fk48Gipv_DTxepfRpah8VbdRTaTPDg)

Our project seeks to further understand the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and the ability to access health care. The reduced access to care and increased psycholgical stressors associated with the pandemic may contribute to unmet mental health needs.

## Data Source

Data was obtained from the Household Pulse Survey data which measures [indicators of anxiety or depression](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/indicators-anxiety-or-depression-based-reported-frequency-symptoms-during-last-7-days) and [indicators of reduced access to care](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/indicators-reduced-access-care-due-coronavirus-pandemic-during-last-4-weeks) during the coronavirus pandemic.

## Data Cleaning

We combined two separate Household Pulse Survey datasets to be able to compare indicators of anxiety or depression and indicators of reduced access to care. Each dataset has three indicators as follows:

Indicators of anxiety or depression:

* Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder
* Symptoms of Depressive Disorder
* Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder

Indicators of access to care:

* Delayed or Did Not Get Care, Last 4 Weeks
* Did Not Get Needed Care, Last 4 Weeks
* Delayed Medical Care, Last 4 Weeks

```{r, extraction, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

           "subgroup",
           "time_period",
           "time_period_label")
```

Our final dataset contains 10,881 observations and 18 variables:

* `phase`: Data  broken up into data collection phases
* `group`: Categories of data (gender, age, education, race, location)
* `state`: Location of data collection (national or specific states)

* `time_period`: 2 week interval of data collection
* `time_period_label`: Label indicating specific dates of data collection
* `mhealth_ind`: Description of anxiety or depression indicator reported
* `mhealth_value`: Percent value of anxiety or depression indicator
* `mhealth_lowci`: Lower estimate of anxiety or depression confidence interval
* `mhealth_highci`: Upper estimate of anxiety or depression confidence interval
* `mhealth_ci`: Confidence interval of anxiety or depression value
* `mhealth_qrange`: Quartile range of anxiety or depression value
* `access_ind`: Description of access to health indicator reported
* `access_value`: Percent value of access to health indicator of each subgroup
* `access_lowci`: Lower estimate of access to health confidence interval
* `access_highci`: Upper estimate of access to health confidence interval
* `access_ci`: Confidence interval of access to health value
* `access_qrange`: Quartile range of access to health value

## Exploratory Analysis 

The following visualizations provide a preliminary look into the relationship between mental health and access to care. This analysis allowed us to develop a hypothesis that increased mental health symptoms and reduced access to care were associated, which we explore more deeply further in this analysis. This association suggests that mental health needs may coincide geographically with reduced access to healthcare, either through a direct relationship or due to confounding factors such as coronavirus incidence and public health measures.

  )
```

#### Proportion Reporting Mental Health Symptoms by Age Group and Education Level from Apr. 23 thru Oct. 26

We found it interesting that symptoms of anxiety and depression increased over the course of the pandemic among all age groups. The following two plots demonstrate that over the course of the first 4-5 months, anxiety and depression levels increased. Around the 12th survey period (August), it appears that symptoms of depression or anxiety decreased across all education levels and age groups. Furthermore, those with "Less than a High School Diploma", on average, had much steeper fluctuations in mental health symptoms than groups with higher education levels.

```{r exploration_pt3}
mhealth_df %>%
  mutate(group = as.factor(group),
         subgroup = as.factor(subgroup)) %>%
  filter(group == "By Age") %>%

    yaxis = list(title = 'Mental Health Symptoms (%)')
  )
```

```{r exploration_pt4}

    xaxis = list(title = 'Time Period (2-Week Intervals)'),
    yaxis = list(title = 'Mental Health Symptoms (%)')
  )
```

#### Proporiton Reporting Reduced Access to Care by Age Group and Education Level from Apr. 23 thru Oct. 26

The corresponding plots of access to care paint an interesting picture. Again, access to care is reduced across all groups during the first 4-5 months of the pandemic and we notice a sharp decrease in individuals reporting reduced access to care over the course of the 10th through 12th time period (July and August). Further investigation is required to understand this change.

```{r exploration_pt5}
access_df %>%
  mutate(group = as.factor(group),
         subgroup = as.factor(subgroup)) %>%
  filter(group == "By Age") %>%
  drop_na(access_value) %>%
  group_by(time_period, subgroup) %>%
  summarize(subgroup,
            time_period,
            access_value) %>%

  )
```

These plots depict averages of anxiety or depression indicators and averages of reduced access to care indicators across all groups. Although mostly spread out, these plots suggest that anxiety or depression symptoms and reduced access may be associated over the course of the coronavirus pandemic. In order to explore this relationship further, we visualized the geographic distribution of mental health symptoms and reduced access to care over time.

## Geographic Visualization of Mental Health Symptoms and Reduced Access to Care

Our previous analyses reveal that many of the top states for incidence of mental health symptoms were also among the top states for reduced access to care. Additionally, increased anxiety and depression symptoms and reduced access to care seem to have similar fluctuations over time across age groups and education levels. These findings motivated us to assess whether mental health symptoms and reduced access to care are associated over the course of the coronavirus pandemic. Scatterplots comparing these variables across all states and time points did not demonstrate a clear association between the incidence of depression or anxiety and reduced access to healthcare. Therefore, we sought to develop a tool that allowed exploration of the geographic distribution of mental health and reduced access to care indicators over the time course of the survey.

In order to accomplish this, we used a package called `leaflet` to create choropleth maps in which each state is assigned a color value according to the proportion (%) of respondents that reported mental health symptoms or reduced access to care. Creating this map required finding an open source dataset that includes the geographic coordinates of state borders that can be used to create polygons in the shape of each state to be colored according to data values. This dataset was made available as a JSON object by [PublicaMundi](https://github.com/PublicaMundi/MappingAPI/blob/master/data/geojson/us-states.json) using publicly available data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Separate choropleth maps were created to represent the proportion of individuals with mental health symptoms and proportion of individuals with reduced access to care in each state.

After creating geographic representations of the data using `leaflet`, the `Shiny` package was used to make these visualizations interactive. Specifically, a slider was created which allows the user to select a survey time period for which to display the geographic data. This scroll bar has been animated to loop over all survey time periods in order to visualize the geographic distribution of mental health and access to care indicators over the course of the coronavirus pandemic.

Below the choropleth maps that represent the geographic distribution of mental health symptoms and reduced access to care during each survey time period is a scatterplot comparing the proportion of individuals who report delaying or not recieving care and the proportion of individuals who report symptoms of anxiety or depression for the selected 2-week survey period across all states. A linear model is used to estimate the relationship between these two variables for each time period.

The resulting interactive visualization is hosted on the `ShinyApps.io` server.

This visualization of the data by survey time period reveals a positive correlation between proportion of individuals who report mental health symptoms and proportion of individuals who report reduced access to care during only some of the 2-week intervals, particularly the most recent survey time periods. This relationship was not as apparent when comparing these variables over all survey time periods, demonstrating the utility of this interactive analysis.

## State Categorization

In order to create another dimension to the data we were working with, we decided to view the data about mental health symptoms and access to care through the lens of the public health measures and restrictions across states. We created three categories: little to no restrictions, moderate restrictions, and strict restrictions. Using a New York Times compilation of restrictions and mask mandates in all 50 states which can be accessed [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html), we used the following variables to categorize states into these three categories.

* States with mandatory stay-at-home orders were automatically placed in the category of strict restrictions; states with mandatory mask mandates as well as most business closures were also placed in consideration for the strict category. The timeliness of the restrictions and the peaks of the cases in the states were also factors for consideration.
* States had to have a minimum of mask mandate in their state as well as some business closures in order to be labeled a state with moderate restrictions.
* All other states were placed under the little to no state restriction category.

```{r}

restrictions_df <- 
  read_csv("data/restrictions.csv")

restrictions_df %>% knitr::kable(digits = 1)


```
```{r}

combined_df %>% filter(group == "By State") %>% arrange(desc(mhealth_value)) %>% select(state) %>% distinct(state) %>% head(10) %>% knitr::kable()

```

Of the 10 states with the highest proportion of individuals reporting symptoms of anxiety or depression over the entire duration of the survey, only two were categorized as having strict public health restrictions while three were categorized as having few or no public health restrictions.

```{r}

combined_df %>% filter(group == "By State") %>% arrange(desc(access_value)) %>% select(state) %>% distinct(state) %>% head(10) %>% knitr::kable()

```
Of the 10 states with the highest proportion of individuals reporting reduced access to care over the entire duration of the survey, five were categorized as having strict public health restrictions. 

These findings suggest that mental health symptoms are not necessarily associated with stricter public health restrictions, whereas states with the greatest number of individuals reporting reduced access to care were more likely to have strict public health restrictions. This association may be mediated through additional factors such as incidence of COVID-19, hospital capacity, and redeployment of healthcare personnel. 

This analysis is also limited by the fact that many states have implemented different public health restrictions during different time periods during the pandemic. A more granular look at incidence of COVID-19 and state-level public health restrictions during the time periods that the survey was conducted would shed greater light on the correlations between these variables.

## Discussion

All plots visually depict those who reported symptoms of anxiety or depression increasing while reported reduced access to care also increases. Based on these visuals, it is interesting to note we see possible stronger linear relationships when roughly more than 30% report symptoms of anxiety or depression. These scatter plots depict only averages of anxiety or depression indicators and averages of reduced access to care indicators, since we did not have access to any individual data points. 

Because all values in this dataframe are averages of each indicator organized into each subgroup (gender, age, education, race, and location), we decided not run any correlation tests. Instead, we chose to create these scatter plots comparing indicators of anxiety or depression to indicators of access to care. We chose to look at values by state to maximize the number of data points while ensuring there are no duplicates. These scatter plots are also limited since they do not control for the varying time periods. In our visual analysis tab, we are able to create plots by time periods and depict these correlations.

Geographic visualization of mental health symptoms and reduced access to care over time further supports the observation that these two indicators are associated. Further analysis of the severity of public health regulations by state suggests that strict regulations are not necessarily associated with increased mental health symptoms, but may be associated with reduced access to care.

Although the data we had access to limited our analyses, we were able to observe possible positive correlations between reduced access to care and symptoms of depression and anxiety suggesting that increased mental health needs during the coronavirus pandemic may not be met. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, mental health concerns are a major public health priority. Increasing funding and expanding funding for telehealth options for mental healthcare is especially important as restrictions and lockdowns may continue into another year.
